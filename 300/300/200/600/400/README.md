# 400 - Deploy Project Files

Following instructions at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs-code?tabs=node-v3%2Cpython-v2%2Cin-process&pivots=programming-language-python

We recommend setting-up [continuous deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-continuous-deployment) so that your function app in Azure is updated when you update source files in the connected source location. You can also deploy your project files from Visual Studio Code.

When you publish from Visual Studio Code, you take advantage of the [Zip deploy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-deployment-technologies#zip-deploy) technology.

**WARNING**: Deploying to an existing function app always overwrites the contents of that app in Azure.
